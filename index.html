			  <h1><strong>Enhancement One</strong></h1>
			<h4><strong>Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering</strong></h4>
			<p>For this enhancement, Software Engineering, and Design, I chose to focus on my first artifact, possibly the one I will be working on through this course. This artifact is an android eCommerce app to sell location coffee shop products. I select this artifact because mobile application development is a great skill to have as a developer and in demand. The second reason I choose this artifact is that it embodies various capabilities needed in the tech industry. Lastly, it showcases my experience with multiple tools such as Firebase API, Facebook API, and the SQLite database embedded in the android mobile OS. I added a second authentication method, which uses firebase because some users might not have Facebook. I will be transitioning from the SQLite database to the firebase database. The reason for that is to add flexibility so that users can instantly access new products without having to reinstall the app.</p>
			<p>I have not fully met the objectives I planned for this enhancement yet because I believe there are still some code structures and designs that need improvement.</p>
			<p>In this process, the lesson learned is that some API, such as Facebook, could be inflexible when implementing it along with other API. I also learned that following the standard design, best practices would save ample time in the long run. The challenges I faced were finding detailed information on how to implement various APIs. As this course progresses, I will keep this design principle from opensource.com in mind “globals are bad. Functions are better than types. Objects are likely to be better than complex data structures” (30 best practices for software development and testing).</p>

			<h1><strong>Enhancement Two</strong></h1>
			<h4><strong>Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structure</strong></h4>
			<p>As mentioned in the TutorialPoing, Data Structures are the programmatic way of storing data so that data can be used efficiently (Data Structure and Algorithms Tutorial). In this assignment, I decided to enhance another part of the Android mobile app, LCS2(Local Coffee Shop), a simple eCommerce app that displays some random items when it starts and gives users the option to search for products, add to cart and place an order. I used the firebase Real-time database to facilitate the implementation of product search, storing, and retrieving order history data. The firebase API method helps with the application of the search algorithm that I used to display products, based on user-entered character(s). According to the Tutorial point site, Algorithm is a step-by-step method, which determines a set of directions to be performed in a specific order to get the desired output (Data Structure and Algorithms Tutorial). I redesign the Order class to include the list of items in the Order, orderDate, total, and ID used in the OrderHistoryAdapter class to display a list of orders.</p>
            <p>I structure the order collection based on user ID and date keys. This method, to my knowledge, is better and more straightforward compare to using SQL, where data distributed between multiple tables.</p>
			 <image src="images/order_structure.png" style="width: 80%;" />
			   </p>
			   <p>The lesson I learned is that exploring a tool before implementing it is a must.
				  I assumed firebase would have a similar querying syntax as in MongoDB, which was not correct.
				  I also discovered that the Firebase Real-time database is for unstructured data, whereas the Cloud Firestore is for structure data.</p>

			<h1><strong>Enhancement Three</strong></h1>
			<h4><strong>Enhancement Three: Databases</strong></h4>
			<p>For this milestone, I select the zookeeper artifact that I worked on in IT-145 using java. The project was a simple role-based authentication system that takes in the zookeeper name and password then determines if he/she is a zookeeper, veterinarian, or administrator. All the credentials retrieved from a file called credentials and using "while/for-loop" to loop through each line of the text file and extract the password and role. The users had only three attempts to authenticate; otherwise, the program will terminate successfully.</p>
			<p><h4>Enhancement:</h4></p>
			<p>I chose to move the credentials to a MySQL database that is more secure and provides more flexibility than a text file. I also decided to move the program from the command line interface to a web interface that is user-friendly and easily accessible across multiple platforms.</p>
			<p>I selected this artifact and the enhancement because it shows my ability to work web development projects using java server faces, Html, and CSS. I did meet the course objectives I planned to comply with this enhancement, which was implementing a database in a server-side project.</p>
			<p>I learned that keeping up to date with all the new versions of API and technology is a must for software engineers. Also, I learned that authentication for the mobile app is a lot simpler compare to web applications.</p>

	    <h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>
	    <p><h4>Educational Journey and Program Reflection</h4></p>
		<p>I have been fascinated by technologies since I was little,
		   especially electronics and anything to do with science.
		   I took my first programming class using Java from September
		   to December 2007, a pre-requisite for AS in mechanical engineering.
		   From there, I decided to get a Certificate as a Java Server Side Programmer.
		   I did not work in computer science because I always felt I needed to learn
		   more, so in 2018, I started a Bachelor of Software Engineering program at SNHU.
		   While in the program, I learned that understanding the concept of programming
		   empowers a developer to learn new languages quickly. My understanding of
		   programming and data structure has improved drastically. In CS-200,
		   I learned some valuable programming skills using Python, which also applies to 
		   many other programming languages. I learned that developing a flowchart or
		   pseudocode is essential in designing well organized and quality products.
		   In CS-200, I understand what algorithm means in computer science and the
		   importance of adequately naming variables and functions, as well as comments
		   within the code that help the developer and his team when testing or debugging.</p>
		<p>The CS-260, Data Structures, and Algorithms class introduced me to lots of new
		   concepts. I first learned about C++, in which I use vectors and structs and
		   implement linear and binary search. In CS-260, I was introduced to linked lists,
		   pointers, Stacks, Queues, and various Sorting algorithms and Trees. For example,
		   Merge, Selection, Insertion, Quicksort, and BST (Binary Search Trees) search
		   algorithms.</p>
		<p>Before CSS-360, The Advanced Programming Concepts class, I was aware of NoSQL
		   but never heard of the MongoDB database or how to develop a RESTful API; this
		   was an exciting class for me because I was made aware of the power and
		   scalability of  NoSQL database versus SQL. Also, I learned about Git and
		   JUnit for version control, team collaboration, and testing. The software
		   Development Life Cycle course introduces me to Agile, Scrum, and Water
		   development methodology and principles, which are essential when working
		   within or managing a project. Developing an interactive 3D object from scratch
		   using C++ and OpenGL was an exciting experience, partly because I hadn't heard
		   of OpenGL before. The Reverse Engineering course illustrates the power of Linux
		   and how to rebuild programs given just the binary code using assembly language.</p>
		<p><h4>Artifacts Introduction</h4></p>
		<p>The first project I would like to select for software engineering and design,
		   which I believe covers all three categories is an Android App called
		   LCS2(Local Coffee Shop). I worked on this project for the CS-360 mobile Architecture.
		   This project simulates a basic eCommerce app where the user can download the app and
		   log in using social media, browser products, add to cart and place the order.
		   I plan to finish the order summary page, add a secondary authentication method,
		   and improve the product search function.</p>
		<p>The last project I select is the zookeeper authentication project using
		   Java programming language developed in IT-145 class. The program uses the
		   command line terminal and requests the user for name and password,
		   which then checks against username and password in a text file.
		   I plan to change the UI of the program to a web interface and use the MySQL
		   database to store user data instead of a text file. This artifact showcases
		   my skill in JSF and Hibernate framework, Html, CSS as well as configuring
		   Tomcat and MySQL database servers.</p>
